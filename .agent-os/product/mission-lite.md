Ballistic Hub serves Fortnite: Ballistic players, fans, creators, and organizers who need a single, dynamic destination. Unlike static hubs, it combines shadcn/ui structural components with Blookie.io animated blooks and real-time Firebase data (including Twitch live checks) to boost engagement and conversion for watching, joining, and signing up.
