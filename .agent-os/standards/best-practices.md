# Best Practices - Agent OS Task Execution System

## Task Management Best Practices
- **Clear Scope Definition**: Each task should have a well-defined scope with clear boundaries
- **Atomic Tasks**: Break down complex features into small, atomic tasks that can be completed independently
- **Dependency Management**: Identify and document task dependencies before starting implementation
- **Progress Tracking**: Use consistent status markers ([ ], [x], [-]) in tasks.md

## TDD Development Approach
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests first, implement minimal code to pass tests, then refactor
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and error scenarios
- **Test Isolation**: Keep tests independent and avoid shared state between test cases
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Use clear, descriptive names that explain what is being tested

## Code Organization Patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class should have one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from presentation and data access layers
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable components with clear interfaces
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase

## Error Handling Strategies
- **Defensive Programming**: Validate inputs and handle edge cases gracefully
- **Meaningful Error Messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Design systems to continue functioning even when some components fail
- **Logging**: Implement appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring

## Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when needed
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for expensive operations
- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of memory usage and clean up resources properly
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Use async/await patterns for non-blocking operations

## Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to components
- **Secure Communication**: Use secure protocols for data transmission
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities

## Documentation Standards
- **README Files**: Include clear README files for each component
- **Code Comments**: Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- **API Documentation**: Document public interfaces and their usage
- **Change Logs**: Maintain change logs to track modifications over time
